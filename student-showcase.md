## [Submit a Student Showcase proposal now!](http://bit.ly/pyconau-2018-student-showcase)

In 2018, for the first time, the PyCon Australia Python in Education Seminar will be hosting a
dedicated afternoon session for high school student presentations.

We are calling for proposals from Australian high school students who are using Python in a project,
class assignment or who are hacking on something cool.
Individual students or small groups can apply, and all levels of experience are
welcome, from complete novices to Python pros.

We are accepting 10-15 minute talk submissions from students from year 7 to 12.

**Student Showcase submissions for 2018 are open from Tuesday, May 1
[Anywhere On Earth (AoE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth) to Monday, June 4 AoE.**

The Student Showcase will take place as part of the PyCon Australia Python in Education Seminar
on the afternoon of Friday, August 24th.

The Python in Education Seminar is a dedicated specialist track at PyCon Australia that focuses on
the use of Python for teaching beginner programmers in the context of a more general education. The
Student Showcase is an opportunity for students to exhibit their projects and tell the story
of how they were made, the problems they had to solve, and how Python helped (or hindered!)
them along the way.

## <a name="basic-information"></a> Basic information

Are you an Australian student using Python for a school or personal project?
Submit [a Student Showcase proposal](http://bit.ly/pyconau-2018-student-showcase) if you'd like
to give a presentation about your project to a mixed audience of fellow students, educators, and
interested and supportive industry professionals.

Note: even for personal projects, submissions will still need to be coordinated through your
school (and the submission form reflects this).

**Student Showcase submissions for 2018 are open from Tuesday, May 1
[Anywhere On Earth (AoE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth) to Monday, June 4 AoE.**

The PyCon Australia Student Showcase is being organised in collaboration with the [Australian
Computing Academy](https://aca.edu.au/).

## <a name="how-to-write-your-proposal"></a> How to write your proposal

The [Student Showcase submission form](http://bit.ly/pyconau-2018-student-showcase) includes
several guiding questions to help organise your proposal.

If you have any questions about formulating your proposal, start out by talking to the teacher
coordinating submissions from your school.

For teachers that have questions, please contact the [Australian Computing Academy](mailto:help@aca.edu.au).

## <a name="conduct-and-expectations"></a> Conduct and expectations

All speakers will be expected to have read and adhere to the conference [Code of Conduct](http://2018.pycon-au.org/conduct/).
For students in particular: if it wouldn't be appropriate in class, it isn't going to be appropriate at the Education Seminar!

## <a name="speaker-benefits"></a> Speaker benefits

Accepted students will have the opportunity to present their work in front of interested and supportive industry professionals. 

They will also be provided with two tickets to the PyCon Australia 2018 Specialist Track day on Friday August 24th, one for themselves, and one for a teacher, parent or guardian.

Arrangements will also be made to allow parents and guardians to attend the Student Showcase itself without needing to purchase a full conference ticket. Please contact [events@aca.edu.au](mailto:events@aca.edu.au)

## <a name="financial-support"></a> Financial support

Don't let finances stop you from submitting a talk proposal. Speakers receive free conference tickets as detailed in "Speaker Benefits", and there is further financial assistance available based on need. See the [financial assistance page](/assistance/) for more details about the selection process and a link to the application form.
