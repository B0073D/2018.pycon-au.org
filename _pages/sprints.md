Development Sprints, also known as just 'sprints', are an unstructured session where attendees can work on projects with peers, hack on things, or see what others are working on. 

PyCon AU will provide the space, power, and internet, you provide the projects. 

Lunch will not be provided; just across the way from the Convention Centre is Harbourside, a shopping complex that has mulitple foodcourts and restaurants.
