## [Click here to submit a talk proposal now!](https://www.papercall.io/pyconau2018)

We want you [to present at PyCon AU](https://www.papercall.io/pyconau2018)!

Tell us about what you've been hacking on, what drives you, what excites you. What have you been learning? What do you want to share?

The 2018 Call for Presentations (CFP) is open from Monday, April 23 [Anywhere On Earth (AoE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth) to Monday, May 28 AoE.

Do you have a talk for the main conference track, or something more specialised for our Friday specialist tracks?

[Submit now!](https://www.papercall.io/pyconau2018)

If you've never presented at a conference before and think you might like to try it, [submit now!](https://www.papercall.io/pyconau2018)

We're looking for 30 minute talks on everything Python, open source, and tech-related.

We welcome submissions from everybody, including those:

* who have never given a conference talk before,
* who are new to Python,
* who have built interesting things in Python, 
* who have broken interesting things with Python,
* who have helped build Python, and
* who have expertise to share with our community from fields outside of Python (and outside of technology).

Thinking of something cool? We want to hear from you!

You can submit a proposal for the main conference, and all of our four Specialist Tracks, [through PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/pyconau2018) or reach us any time with questions at **<mailto:program@pycon-au.org>**.

## Specialist Tracks

The first day of PyCon AU is dedicated to specialist tracks. These tracks, also known as 'mini-confs', are curated by smaller specialist groups within Python community, and allow for more in-depth talks on the subject. 

In 2018, these tracks will be: DjangoCon, Security and Privacy, Education, and Internet of Things. [Read more](http://2018.pycon-au.org/news/specialist-tracks).

You can submit to any or all of these Specialist Tracks [through PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/pyconau2018).

(Applications for the Education Seminar Student Track will be taken here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeT8witEHPrvvYLr4QflguAYVr3zdvHKNdDnoFm2qR_HHDhBg/viewform).

## Mentors

In order to support speakers, we offer mentorship and feedback to those who would like it.

A mentor is an experienced presenter who has volunteered to help other presenters. For first-time presenters, non-native English speakers, under-confident or uncertain speakers, or anyone who would just appreciate another set of eyes, our mentors are here to help. Youâ€™ll get the best results by forming a relationship with one mentor, rather than contacting several.

Our mentors are happy to help with any of the following:

* Exploring and brainstorming your interests to help you identify hidden things that would make great talks
* Connecting you with experienced speakers to help build your proposal and talk
* Reviewing your outline, slide deck, or presenter notes
* Connecting you with rehearsal audiences or even just watching you present over a video conference as practice
* Anything else that'd help you be at ease and excited about bringing your ideas to our audience!

### Our mentors

If you would like some help from a mentor, you can reach out to them directly:

* [Katie Bell](): experienced international speaker, PyCon AU 2018 organiser, developer, and code archaeologist
* [Lilly Ryan](<mailto:mentoring@attacus.net>): experienced international speaker, security engineer, former historian, and current Papers Chair for PyCon AU 2018
* [Richard Jones](): Python Software Foundation Fellow, former PyCon AU organiser, speaker, and engineer

## How to write your proposal

If you have an idea (or don't!) and want to speak, here's a very rough process of what you should do next:

* Brainstorm or mind map to expand upon your ideas or knowledge in search of a general topic
* Write a paragraph or two, or some bullet points, to outline the core concepts you want to communicate and what people might learn from your talk
* Get someone you trust to read your notes and tell you what they think they'd learn
* Ask one of our mentors for help with building up your submission
* Practice!

This [public speaking repository](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking), maintained by [VM Brasseur](https://twitter.com/vmbrasseur), has many useful resources to help you polish your proposals and talks.

## Conduct and expectations

All speakers will be expected to have read and adhere to the conference Code of Conduct, which can be found [here](http://2018.pycon-au.org/conduct/). In particular for speakers: slide contents and spoken material should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate, and neither are language or imagery that denigrate or demean people based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, or body size.

## Anonymity

Our submission process is anonymous. This means our reviewers will not know anything about your identity while assessing your proposal.

Please avoid including identifying information like your name or your pronouns (he/she/they) anywhere in your proposal so that our reviewers can assess your talk by itself.

## Benefits

Proposals which are accepted will receive one free ticket to PyCon Australia 2018. You are welcome to propose a talk with more than one speaker, but please be aware that if it is accepted, only one complimentary ticket will be allocated.

## Financial support

PyCon Australia has a budget for providing financial assistance to those who may need it. Speakers are very welcome to apply, but please note that financial assistance for speakers is not guaranteed.

You can read more about our policy and submit a financial assistance application [here](http://2018.pycon-au.org/assistance).
