We want you to speak. 

Tell us about what you've been hacking on, what drives you, what excites you. What have you been learning? What do you want to share?

The Call for Presentations will open in early 2018, so start thinking. 

Do you have a talk for the main conference track, or something more specialised for our Friday specialist tracks?

The sort of things we're looking for: 

 * Projects that use Python in interesting ways
 * Development of CPython
 * Testing code
 * Professional skills
 * Interesting bits of Python
 * Python on other platforms
 * ...

Thinking of something else? We want to hear from you!

### Financial assistance

Don't let finances stop you from submitting a talk proposal. Speakers receive free conference tickets and there is further financial assistance available based on need. See the [financial assistance page](/assistance/) for more details about the selection process and a link to the application form.
