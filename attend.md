### Tickets

Tickets for PyCon AU will open shortly after the [Call for Proposals](/speak/)
results are announced.

There will be some limited Early Bird tickets, which will get you discounted
entry to all three days of the conference.

Don't forget to plan ahead of the Development Sprints. Are you going to be
sticking around after the weekend? Come back to the venue and join other
conference attendees, full of fresh ideas, and develop on your favourite pet
project, or discover something new to participate in.

Development Sprint tickets will be sold separately to the main event.

### Location

All of PyCon AU will be held at the [International Convention
Center](https://www.iccsydney.com.au/about-icc-sydney), in Sydney's Darling
Harbour. We'll be using the Cockle Bay room for our full-conference
presentations, and other rooms on Level 3 for our tracks. 

The venue will have digital signage directing attendees to the conference. 


### Financial assistance

Thanks to the support of our sponsors, we have budget set aside for providing financial assistance for people who might otherwise find it difficult to attend PyCon AU. See the [financial assistance page](/assistance/) for more details about the selection process and the application form.
