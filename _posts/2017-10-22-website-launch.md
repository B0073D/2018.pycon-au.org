We have a website for PyCon AU 2018!

This year, you may notice something slightly different. We're using a statically generated site instead of a conference application. This means a few things, but one of the biggest advantages is that this entire website is open source. 

If you see any issues on the site -- spelling errors, css issues, or you want to suggest improvements -- you can check out the [conference repo](https://github.com/pyconau/2018.pycon-au.org) on GitHub, and submit a Pull Request there.
