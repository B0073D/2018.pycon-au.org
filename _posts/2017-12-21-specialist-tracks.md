title: Specialist Tracks Confirmed!
---

Each year at PyCon AU, we dedicate a day to our Specialist Tracks. These are single-day “mini-conferences”, where each room has a specific theme, curated by members of the community. 

We are pleased to announce that after receiving several proposals for Specialist Tracks from across the community, we have a solid line-up of four tracks to choose from on the day.

**DjangoCon Australia**
- Returning for its sixth year, this track is all things Django.

**Security and Privacy**
- Building security and privacy into your Python project, security 101, defensive code, software ethics, and much more.

**Education**
- Bringing together educators who are using Python in teaching or looking for new ways to use coding in education. Sharing stories, strategies and techniques for teaching with Python.

**Internet of Things**
- Exploring the ways in which Python powers IoT devices, applications, and services, as well as advice on using Python to analyse data, and how to get the most out of the Python ecosystem in the IoT field.

The Call for Presentations for these tracks, and the main conference, will open mid 2018.
