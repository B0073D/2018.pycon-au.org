We are currently looking for people to help in the early organisational phase of planning.

We are seeking a: 

 * Communications Chair
   * This person will help us co-ordinate these news posts, social media, and attendee communications
 * Sponsorship Chair
   * This person will be our link to sponsors, helping to find and sign on organisations that will help fund our event. 

If you are interested in any of these positions, please [get in touch!](mailto:contact@pycon-au.org). If you have any questions, just ask!
