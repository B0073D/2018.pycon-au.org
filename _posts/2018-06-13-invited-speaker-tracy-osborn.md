<hr>

Author of [Hello Web Books](https://hellowebbooks.com/), Tracy is no stranger to PyCons around the world, and will be making her way to her first PyCon AU in August to give a presentation entitled: "Clueless".

> Tracy Osborn is the author, designer, and self-publisher of three books and
> the solo founder of a venture-backed startup. Each of these achievements has
> something in common â€” being completely clueless about the work and problems
> involved in each. In this keynote, Tracy will tell stories about how she
> launched her projects and what she learned (after already being neck-deep.)

Tickets for PyCon AU will go on sale soon, with a limited number of Early Bird tickets being made available.
