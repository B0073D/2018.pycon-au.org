abstract: Walk through some common scenarios you will encounter with OpenID Connect
  and receive practical guidance on using Python to get authenticated and your job
  done.
---
Many of us encounter authentication protocols as a side effect of just trying to get things done. The simple task of accessing data from a client API or integrating with third parties balloons out into a yak shaving session filled with obtuse authentication failure messages. We will walk through a number of scenarios involving one of the most common protocols, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and offer practical guidance on productively using Python to work with it.

This talk will give you enough foundation to ask the right questions of system owners you are interacting wtih. As well as an understanding of tools that will enable you to quickly stand up a client or server that uses OIDC safely and securely.
