        Python has been our language of choice for over 6 years - in that time we've
        deployed Python code for clients including VicRoads, Qantas, Myer, Coles,
        Telstra, BOC, State and Federal Government departments and many others. We have
        active projects using Django, Twisted, Celery, Channels, Pandas and many other
        open source tools from the Python community, so we’re very happy to have this
        opportunity to make a small contribution in return.
